# Product Recommendation System using Sentence Transformers

## Introduction

This project demonstrates an advanced product recommendation engine designed for e-commerce platforms. By leveraging Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for semantic understanding, the system interprets and matches user queries with relevant products—even when keywords don’t exactly match—enabling more accurate and personalized recommendations.

Key highlights:

Text Embedding: Used Sentence-BERT to convert product descriptions and user queries into vector representations.

Semantic Search: Applied cosine similarity to recommend contextually similar products.

MLOps Integration: The model pipeline is containerized using Docker, tracked with MLflow, and deployed via Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

User Interface: Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time search and recommendation visualization.

This project is a scalable solution to enhance search experience and product discovery in modern e-commerce platforms.
